                    Let's keep this short. If you haven't notice, I love building iOS apps in my free time.
                    It's really fun and challenging. And with the new SwiftUI framework introduced in WWDC19,
                    iOS development just got more and more excited as ever!<br />
                </p>

                <p>
                    Apart from building apps, I enjoyed researching in UI/UX to ensure users have the best
                    experience in using the app.
